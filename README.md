The default theme for [Cachet](https://github.com/CachetHQ/Cachet).

## Design

The design we're implementing will be based on https://github.com/CachetHQ/Cachet/files/2112715/Cachet.pdf, designed by @thomasHolman and named after his :dog:

Cachet will require changes to its existing theming system to simplify the options that can be provided to a theme. In the future, [Coccon](https://github.com/CachetHQ/Cocoon) will be able to support loading custom routes into themes, which will allow it to register its own theme management pages.
